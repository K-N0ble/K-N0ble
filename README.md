# ðŸ‘‹ Hi! My name is Kristen Noble

I am currently a student at SAIT, studying web development. I also have a part-time job at London Drugs as both a Tech and a Photolab Specialist. I am pursuing my interests in both art and technology through my schooling as well as my own personal studies.

## More about me -
I attended a very small private school in Airdrie from kindergarten until I graduated. I have lived in Airdrie for my entire life and have only traveled inside of North America. I have a passion for snowboarding so I would love to travel to Japan as well as a couple places in Europe to experience their mountains as well!

### Some of my hobbies are:
- Gaming
- Snowboarding
- Art
