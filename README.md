# ðŸ‘‹ Hi! My name is Kristen Noble

I am currently a student at SAIT, studying web development. I also have a part-time job at London Drugs as both a Tech and a Photolab Specialist. I am pursuing my interests in both art and technology through my schooling as well as my own personal studies.

## More About Me -
I attended a *very* small private school in Airdrie from kindergarten until I graduated. I have lived in Airdrie for my entire life and have only traveled inside of North America. I have a passion for snowboarding so I would love to travel to Japan as well as a couple places in Europe to experience their mountains as well!

### **Some of my Hobbies are:**
- Gaming
- Snowboarding
- Art

### Future Interests:
I am interested in learning different programming languages, especially object-oriented languages. Becoming proficient in more languages will help me advance my career, as well as give me the tools to work on personal projects.
